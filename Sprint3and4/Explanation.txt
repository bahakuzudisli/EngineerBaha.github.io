FEATURE AND REQUESTS:
I used fotorama and google map as widget. Fotorama let me iterate between pictures and google map shows the location of coffe house. 
I used validate,fancybox ve Sticky as pluins. validate controls the textfields are or aren't correct, fancybox make pictures bigger(to see) and
Sticky make navigation line stick on the head of web page. 
I used 2 AJAX, one of them is Json (external file), I put external file to same path with project, in the CoffeHouseMenuComponent file. The other one is extracting 
weather datas wit api to see how is weather on the coffe house. Customers can see 7 days of weather.

FUTURE OF THE WEBSÄ°TE AND USIBILITY:
Mostly coffe lovers are gonna use this web site. The main goal is brighten customers about coffe house, where is the coffe house? what are the products?
How is the weather next few days in there? I have a question, how can i interact with them? Customer can take all the answer for these question.
I wanna make Customers happy. They are gonna see all information about my coffe house in coffe prices to weather stituation. They are gonna see
whole menu, location, weather for 7 days, specials and prices. They can interact of the owner as well.
Finally I wanna add some feature to my web site. It is the ordering online. I have to learn some other things for that but for now it is ok.
